Q1.Role of Frontend(FE)
Explain the role of Frontend (FE) in a web Application.
Include  points related to:
User Intrerface 
User Interaction 
Communication with backend
ANS:-- Frontend helps to see web application that users interact with it.
Frontend usage various  languages like HTML,CSS,JavaScript,react,angular,Vue to create the web applications.frontend helps to creates the websites and web application.frontend is accessible  to the user only to create interactive web pages.
Frontend always focuses on the good presentations,iteraction, and proper communication with the backend works.
In User Interface frontend is responsible for the designing and displaying the layout for the web application.It also includes the elements to make interactive page for the users usage  elements are such as creating buttons,forms,navigation menus,text,images...etc its used in the structure,styling and behaviours in the user interfaces(UI)
In User interactions  where the frontend handles the user actions to clicking on the button to filling the forms scrolling down to continue filling it after completion of pages to click on the submit button or typing input in that further actions its providing the instant feedback for validation messages, and alerts.
The frontend communicate with backend as sending the request to the backend APIs to recieves the data from the backend and display for its users.for example like the user sending the login detail  to the server and ite showing the successfully or occuring error messages.


Q2 .ROLE OF BACKEND(BE): Explain the role of backend (BE)in a web application .Includes the points related to the :-(1) server-side processing, (2)Database handling, (3)Security and authentication.
ANS:--Backend is something that running behind the screen which helps in running the server.Backend is the managing the data,logics,commications medium between the frontend and the database its is essential for the web application to the function correctly and don't visible to the users .
server-side processing is the side where handle the business logic and rules for applications.It also processsing the request sent to the frontend and aslo performing the operations like the validations of data ,calculations.etc.sending the appropriate responses form backend to the frontend.The role of backend for web application is database handling which is managing the data storage ,retrieval ,updating,and deletion of data for the secure web application ensuring the data consistency and its intergity,data optimizing for better performance and its scalability.
The backend is  the security and authentication that managing the users data provides the security and authentication to them in the login,logout,signin ,signup or session handling.Its protects sensitive data using encryption and also secure protocols.Its also prevents the security from the unauthorized the access.

Q3.What is business logic ? explain in detail and give at atleast 3 real-world examples where business is applied in a web application .
ANS:--Business Logic is the set of rules and the conditional statements that defines the how to  business operates in the software applications and also determines what should we happen when specific actions occurs in the server. 
business logic are represents the real-world business rules in different scenario.They are some real world example such as  e-commerce websites or platforms  they offers or apply the discounts only if cart value greater than $300 and preventing orders the out of stock products also calculates the tax based on users location.Bank application prevents the withdrawals if balance is insufficent and its apply the interest monthly on it .They give limit daily transactions amounts for withdrawals or transaction through the online payment. Banking system is verifies the account balance before processing each time we  withdrawal the amounts .Online booking system also prevent double booking  of the seats or rooms.Its locks the selected seats for 5 minutes during the payment.Increases the ticket price during peaks hours.they also allows the cancellation only before a deadline.In learning management system in various university or institution they controls academic operation such as attendance below 75% they will blocks the exam registration.Exams are accesible only during the a scheduled time table in partcular month.It's grades will provides after teacher approvals marks will be released for all.

Q4.Client -Server Model 
what is the client -server-model?
who is the client ?
who is the server?
how communication happens between them.
ANS:-- The client-server-model is a networking architecture where a client send request to the server ,which processes them and returns the required data.The architeture where the clients request services and servers providing the services over the network.client are the usually a web browsers or mobile apps where the client send the requests for exaples like login,signup ,sign-in,fetching the data and diplaying the results to the users on google chrome ,mobile app.
Server is the machine or various  applications that processess the request of the users .Its runs the backend code and accesses the databases and sends the responses back to the client.communication  happens between them client and server, the client sends the http request and the server process the request after that sends it responses in form of data or status to client display the results on the browser.


Q5.Three-tier architecture .what is 3 tier Architecture in web application? Explain the each layer :
Ans:--The 3-tier architecture is a widely used software architecture that divides an web application into the three separate layers for better scalability,security,and its maintenance.
Layers of 3-Tier Architecture are the presentation layer (frontend):- The UI that users interact with layer.Its handle the users interaction and displays them and technologies are HTML,CSS,Javascript,React,Angular.
Application Layer(backend):- the  business logic  that processes requests and applies the business rules.It is processes user request and rules and its technologies are Node.js,java,python,.net.
Data layer(database):- this storage system where the application data is manages the data storage and its retrievals.Also includes the database and data access the logics and technologies are MySQL,MongoDB.Those Architecture are used for the better separation of concerns and its easier to maintenance and scalability also improved in the security and allows the indepedent developments in the each architecture layers

Q6.Javascript as a backend language.why is Javascript used as a backend language?explain with points such as: performance,ecosystem,popular frameworks.

ANS:-- Javascript is widely used as a backend language mainly because of Node.js,which allows the javascript to running outside the browser,Node.js is a runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server side,and making its so popular choice for the backend development.
They are some point such as performance of javascript using the google's V8 engine which complies the javascript into the machine codes,making its very faster and its follows the non-blocking,event-driven architecture meaning it can handle many concurrent requests efficiently.javascript is a single threaded language meaning its excutes code line by ina a synchronous manner.However,to the handle multiple tasks efficiently, the browser provides asynchronous execution using web APIs and event loop.The single language for frontend and backend developers can use javascript on the both client-side and server-side reducing the context switching the code reuse is possible ,which improve the productivity and consistency.Larger ecosystem with the npm (node package manager) node.js has a vast collection of open sources libraries,making development faster and easier.npm provides the millions of libraries and packages for authenication ,database, APIs,etc.Their are some popular backend frameworks as
